A miscellaneous collection of commands and listener modules.  **All**
features can be configured to be _disabled|enabled_ so as to co-exist
with other plugins.

This plugin is focused more towards commands to help system
administration.

## Documentation

This plugin collects a number of commands and listener plugins that I
find useful and wanted to have in a single plugin rather through
multiple ones.  The available commands and listener modules can be
configured.  This allows this plugin to co-exist peacefully with other
plugins.

### Command Reference

The following commands are available:

<!-- template: gd2/subcmds.md -->
* after: schedule command after a number of seconds<br/>
  usage: **after** _&lt;seconds&gt;_ _&lt;command&gt;|list|cancel_ _&lt;id&gt;_

<!-- end-include -->

<!-- snippet: cmdnotes  -->

Commands scheduled by **at** and **after** will only run as
long as the server is running.  These scheduled commands will *not*
survive server reloads or reboots.  If you want persistent commands,
it is recommended that you use a plugin like
[TimeCommander](http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/timecommander.768/).

<!-- end-include -->

### Module reference

<!-- php:$h=4; -->
<!-- template: gd2/mods.md -->
#### blood-particles

Display particles when a player gets hit

#### broadcast-ft

Broadcast player's using FastTransfer

This listener module will broadcast when a player uses FastTransfer

#### broadcast-tp

Broadcast player teleports

This listener module will broadcast when a player teleports to
another location.  It also generates some smoke and plays a sound.


#### cmd-selector

Implements "@" command prefixes

Please refer to the CommandSelector section

#### join-mgr

Announce joining ops, and show server motd

This listener module will broadcast a message for ops joining
a server.

Also, it will show the server's motd on connect.

#### repeater

Uses **!!** to repeat command with changes

If you want to repeat a previous command enter **!!** *without* any "/"
in front.  This works for commands and chat messages.

You can optionally append additional text to **!!** to do certain
things:

* **!!** number
  - Will let you paginate output.  For example, entering:
    - /mw ls
    - !!2
    - !!3
  - This will start showing the output of **/mw ls** and consecutive pages.
* **!!** /
  - if you forgot the "/" in front, this command will add it.  Example:
    - help
    - !!/
* **!!** _text_
  - Will append _text_ to the previous command.  For example:
    - /gamemode
    - !! survival john
  - This will show the usage of survival, the next line will change the
    gamemode of john to survival.
* **!!** str1 str2
  - Will repeat the previous command replacing `str1` with `str2`
    Example:
    - /give player drt
    - !!drt dirt
  - This will change **drt** into **dirt**.
* **!!^** _text_
  - Will insert _text_ at the beginning of the command.

## Command Selectors
<!-- snippet: cmdselector  -->

This adds "@" prefixes for commands.
See
[Command Prefixes](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands#Target_selector_arguments)
for an explanation on prefixes.

This only implements the following prefixes:

- @a - all players
- @e - all entities (including players)
- @r - random player/entity

The following selectors are implemented:

- c: (only for @r),count
- m: game mode
- type: entity type, use Player for player.
- name: player's name
- w: world

<!-- end-include -->

### Configuration

Configuration is through the **config.yml** file.
The following sections are defined:

<!-- php:$h=4; -->
<!-- template: gd2/cfg.md -->
#### broadcast-tp

*  world: world broadcast setting. If true, will broadcast teleports accross worlds.
*  local: local broadcast setting. This will broadcast teleports that go beyond this number.

#### cmd-selector

*  max-commands: Limit the ammount of commands generated by @ prefixes

#### features


This section you can enable/disable commands and listener modules.
You do this in order to avoid conflicts between different
PocketMine-MP plugins.  It has one line per feature:

   feature: true|false

If **true** the feature is enabled.  if **false** the feature is disabled.

#### freeze-thaw

*  hard-freeze: how hard to freeze players. If **true** no movement is allowed.  If **false**, turning is allowed but not walking/running/flying, etc.

#### join-mgr

*  adminjoin: broadcast whenever an op joins
*  servermotd: show the server's motd when joining

#### serverlist

This section configures peer servers.  This can be used with
*rcon* and *query* commands.
