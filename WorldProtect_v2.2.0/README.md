## Documentation

This plugin let's you limit what happens in a world.

<!-- snippet: docs -->
Some items are able to modify a world by being consume (i.e. do not
need to be placed).  For example, _bonemeal_, _water or lava buckets_.
To prevent this type of griefing, you can use the **banitem**
feature.

It is possible to create limits in your limitless worlds.
So players are not able to go beyond a preset border.  This is
useful if you want to avoid overloading the server by
generating new Terrain.

Show a text file when players enter a world.  To explain players
what is allowed (or not allowed) in specific worlds.  For example
you could warn players when they are entering a PvP world.

This plugin protects worlds from griefers by restricing placing and breaking
blocks.  Worlds have three protection levels:

* unlock - anybody can place/break blocks
* protect - players in the _authorized_ list or, if the list is empty,
  players with **wp.cmd.protect.auth** permission can place/break
  blocks.
* lock - nobody (even *ops*) is allowed to place/break blocks.

<!-- end-include -->
